Profile READ ME:
This is a short tutorial on how to use the profiles for plotting.

In graph_script.py, the user may notice that each instance of a plot is accompanied by args='profile'. These 'profiles'
are json files, and are used in single_plot.py to give complete control over the aesthetics of the plot in an
easy-to-use way. The bare bones of a profile can be found in example.json and include the following:

  "plot-type": [line or scatter],
  "title": title of the plot,
  "label_title_x": X-axis title,
  "label_title_y": Y-axis title,
  "line_names": [line names for the legend],
  "legend": bool to specify existence of a legend,
  "grid": bool to specify existence of a grid,
  "pens": [Line styling such as color and width],
  "symbols": [list containing symbols types and sizes of points],
  "x-lim": X-axis limits,
  "y-lim": Y-axis limits,
  "label_style": {label styling such as color, font-size, font-weight, etc},
  "title_style": {title styling such as color, font-size, font-weight, etc}

  NOTE:
  Anything wrapped in a list '[]' must be a 1xL matrix corresponding to the number of lines included in the plot.
